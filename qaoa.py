"""
This is an implementation of the quantum approximation algorithm as proposed in [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028) by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann.
Our implementation draws much guidance from [Google's tutorial](https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/qaoa) and improves it by allowing for a much wider range of graphs to be operated on. This is only possible since our implementation is simulated on a classical computer (where the relative "position" and "connections" between the simulated qubits are not taken into account).
